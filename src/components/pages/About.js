                Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I have a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut and a background in Quality Assurance. 
                Currently, I work for GameChanger by Dick's Sporting Goods as the Software Release Manager. I have experience in UI test automation, CI, and 
                quality monitoring. I am hoping to gain experience and refine my skills in web development.
